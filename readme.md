# Vision Assistant Pro Documentation

**Vision Assistant Pro** is an advanced, multi-modal AI assistant for NVDA. It leverages Google's Gemini models to provide intelligent screen reading, translation, voice dictation, and document analysis capabilities.

_This add-on was released to the community in honor of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities._

## 1. Setup & Configuration

Go to **NVDA Menu > Preferences > Settings > Vision Assistant Pro**.

- **API Key:** Required. You can enter multiple keys (separated by commas or new lines). The assistant will automatically rotate between them if a quota limit is reached.
- **AI Model:** Choose between **Flash** (Fastest/Free), **Lite**, or **Pro** (High Intelligence) models.
- **Proxy URL:** Optional. Use this if Google is blocked in your region. It must be a web address that acts as a bridge to the Gemini API.
- **OCR Engine:** Choose between **Chrome (Fast)** for quick results or **Gemini (Formatted)** for superior layout preservation and table recognition.
- **TTS Voice:** Select the preferred voice style for generating audio files from document pages.
- **Smart Swap:** Automatically swaps languages if the source text matches the target language.
- **Direct Output:** Skips the chat window and announces the AI response directly via speech.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Automatically copies the AI response to the clipboard.

## 2. Command Layer & Shortcuts
